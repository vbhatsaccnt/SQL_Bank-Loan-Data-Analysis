# Bank Loan Data Analysis

Welcome to the Bank Loan Data Analysis project repository. This project explores a dataset related to bank loans, aiming to derive insights and make data-driven decisions.

## Project Overview

In this project, we analyze a dataset containing information about bank loans. The primary objectives include understanding the characteristics of borrowers, assessing risk factors, and gaining insights into the loan approval process.



## Tech Stack

**DataBase Language:** SQL

**Server:** Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 2019

## Lessons Learned

What I Learned:

    SQL Proficiency: Strengthened my SQL skills by working extensively with complex queries, aggregations, and data manipulation.

    Data Exploration: Gained experience in exploring and understanding a dataset, identifying key features, and extracting meaningful insights.

    Risk Assessment: Developed a deeper understanding of risk factors in the context of loan approval, particularly regarding credit scores and interest rates.

Challenges Faced and Solutions:

    Data Quality: Dealing with missing or inconsistent data. I addressed this by carefully cleaning and preprocessing the data, filling missing values, and handling outliers.

    Performance Optimization: When working with large datasets, optimizing SQL queries for performance can be a challenge. I optimized queries by indexing columns and utilizing query execution plans.

    Understanding Business Context: Understanding the domain-specific nuances of the banking and loan industry was a challenge. I overcame this by conducting research, consulting domain experts, and seeking feedback.
